# Automaton-Drawer

Project developed using kotlin programming language and Jgraph/Javafx for the UI implementation.

The project consists in topics merely of Computational Theory of Automatons, providing the ease to model automatons graphically and transforming them to regular expressiosns and backwards.
#Solving  

*Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)  

*Non Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)  

*Non Deterministic Finite Automaton Epsilon (NFAe)  

*Push Down Automaton (PDA)  

*Turing Machine  

#Convertions Supported  

*From NFA to DFA  

*From NFAe to DFA  

*From DFA to Regular Expression(Regex)  

*From Context Free Grammar(CFG or CFL) to PDA  

*Minimizing DFA  

*Regular Expression to NFAe  

#Automaton Operations Supported  

*Union  

*Intersection  

*Subtraction  

*Complement
